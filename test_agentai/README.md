# Python Script to Process JSON lines with OpenAI Functions

This Python script processes JSON lines using OpenAI functions. The script takes in JSON lines and a user request, processes the JSON lines based on the user request using OpenAI functions, and then returns the processed JSON lines.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later
- `agentai` Python library (hypothetical)

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.6 or later. You can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install the `agentai` library. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip install agentai
```

## Usage

1. Define your OpenAI functions using the `@tool` decorator from the `agentai` library. These functions will be used to process the JSON lines.

2. Define the main function that will process the JSON lines. This function should take in a JSON line, parse the information, call the appropriate OpenAI function(s), process the results, and return the processed JSON line.

3. Call the main function with the JSON lines and the user request that you want to process.

Here is a basic usage example:

```python
json_lines = json.dumps({
    "location": "Bengaluru, India",
    "format": "celsius"
})
user_request = "what is the weather like today?"

print(process_json_lines(json_lines, user_request))
```

In this example, `json_lines` is a string containing the JSON lines to process, and `user_request` is a string containing the user request. The `process_json_lines` function processes the JSON lines based on the user request and prints the processed JSON lines.

## Notes

This script is a basic skeleton of how you can process JSON lines using OpenAI functions. Depending on your specific use case, you may need to modify this script, add error handling, logging, etc.

The `agentai` package is a hypothetical one, based on the provided code, and might not exist. You may have to replace it with the actual package providing similar functionality or implement the functionality yourself.
